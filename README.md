# HR-Analysis-Employee-Attrition-Classification
The project aims to predict if an employee will leave the company or not using two datasets. Dataset A is provided by IBM and dataset B is provided by another company. They have different number of samples and use unlike features. To solve the attrition classification problem, I use three machine learning methods, i.e. Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Adaboost. In each method, I use cross-validation to choose the best parameters and use the best parameters to predict the attrition of unseen employees.  Logistic regression performs best on dataset A while random forest performs best on dataset B. I get a good predictive score on dataset B but a ‘bad’ score on dataset A. By comparing the features and predictive scores of two datasets, I give some conjecture about the results.
